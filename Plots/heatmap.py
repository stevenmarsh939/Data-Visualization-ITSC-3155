# The data variable holds information about the heatgraph squares in the heatgraph.
# This code says that the heatgraph squares x axis hold values for days and its y axis holds
# values for the week of the month. The z variable holds the number that determines what color
# each square will be, and in this case, the z variable changes based on the amount of recovered
# corona virus cases.
#
# The colorscale is the list of colors that the heatmap can use to represent its z variable.
# The colorscale "Jet" must be a premade coloring method that we chose for the graph.
#
