# Preparing data
# Student Notes
#
# The data variable holds information about the bubbles in the bubblechart. This code says that the bubbles x axis
# holds values for recovered cases and its y axis holds values for unrecovered cases. The text variable says that
# each bubble represents a country, and that the text displayed when hovering over each bubble will be a country's name.
# Setting the mode to markers indicates that this data is for bubbles in a
# bubblechart. The marker variable deals with the sizing of bubbles and the coloring of the graph's bubbles.
# Showscale = true means that the color gradient scale will be displayed on the finalized graph.
#

# Preparing layout
# Student Notes
#
# The layout variable holds data for the base graph that the bubbles will be displayed on. This
# includes the graphâ€™s title and its x and y axis title labels. The hovermode variable is set to closest, which means
# that whatever bubble is the closest to the user's mouse pointer is that one that will be displayed.
#

# Plot the figure and saving in a html file
