# Similar to the stacked bar graph, the multilinechart has different line types that represent different data.
# To differentiate between the different types of lines, trace variables are made during preparation. In this
# instance, there are three trace variables which represent the three line types: death, recovered, and unrecovered.
# All of the line types use date as their x axis variable, and have either death, recovered, or unrecovered as their y
# axis variable. The data for the different line types are collected into one variable "data".

# The layout variable holds data for the base graph that the lines will be displayed on. This
